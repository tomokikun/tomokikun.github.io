# Sunset - Animated SVG Art

## Concept

This artwork originates from a profound personal experience with the nature of perception and change. 

The sunset's transformation is so gradual that it becomes invisible to our focused attention. The extremely slow change of the sky's color, the subtle evolution of cloud forms, and the shifting hues remain unrecognized when we stare directly at them. But the moment we look away and then return, the change becomes suddenly, dramatically apparent.

This piece captures that moment of recognition - the moving emotional impact of suddenly perceiving what was always happening but remained hidden from direct observation.

## Visual Expression

The SVG animation uses:
- **Turbulence filters** to create the continuous, imperceptible motion
- **Displacement mapping** that shifts and flows like atmospheric changes
- **Gradient transitions** between warm and cool tones, mimicking sunset colors
- **Extended duration** (120 seconds) to mirror the actual slowness of natural change
- **Looping animation** that represents the cyclical nature of daily transitions

## The Paradox of Attention

Just as we cannot see the sunset change by staring at it, this artwork reveals its transformations most clearly in our peripheral vision, in the moments when we're not trying to catch the change happening. The turbulence operates on a frequency that mirrors natural atmospheric motion - always present, always changing, but requiring a shift in attention to truly perceive.

## Technical Implementation

- **SVG animation** with fractal noise turbulence
- **baseFrequency animation** from 0.05 to 1 and back over 120 seconds
- **Gaussian blur** for atmospheric softness
- **Circular elements** with gradient fills representing celestial bodies
- **Path-based motion** creating orbital, cyclical movement
