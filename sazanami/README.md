# Sazanami - Wave Interference Art

## Concept

**Sazanami** (さざ波, meaning "ripples" in Japanese) is a generative art piece that visualizes the dynamics of dialogue and collective understanding through wave interference patterns.

The artwork metaphorically represents how individual voices in a conversation create ripples of thought that interact, interfere, and ultimately reveal the contours of shared understanding within a team or group.

## The Metaphor

### Wave Sources (Individual Voices)
- **Fixed wave sources** represent different speakers or perspectives in a dialogue
- Each source emits waves with unique colors, frequencies, and intensities
- Sources can appear gradually over time, simulating how participants join conversations
- The **mouse cursor** can optionally become an interactive voice, allowing you to participate

### Floating Spheres (Participants/Concepts)
- **Floating spheres** represent participants or concepts being discussed
- They are physically affected by the wave field, moving and oscillating based on wave intensity
- Each sphere has a "home position" but gets displaced by wave forces
- Their colors blend with the surrounding waves, showing influence and adaptation
- The spheres' movement visualizes how ideas and people are swayed by the collective discourse

### The Central Obstacle (Shared Understanding)
- A **dynamic, organic shape** at the screen center represents emerging collective understanding
- This invisible barrier affects wave propagation, creating subtle boundaries
- The obstacle's form shifts smoothly using noise, representing the fluid nature of consensus
- When waves encounter this shared understanding, they create interference patterns that make its boundaries visible

### Wave Interference (Dialogue Dynamics)
- Waves from different sources **interfere** with each other, creating complex patterns
- Areas where waves reinforce create bright, intense regions (agreement, resonance)
- Areas where waves cancel create darker regions (disagreement, silence)
- The **color mixing** shows how different perspectives blend and influence each other
- Wave **diffraction** around the central obstacle creates the subtle emergence of shared boundaries

## Visual Language

- **Dark background**: The unknown, unexplored space of potential understanding
- **Colored waves**: Individual contributions, thoughts, and expressions
- **Wave interference**: The complex interplay of multiple perspectives
- **Floating spheres**: People or concepts being shaped by the dialogue
- **Central obstacle**: The collective understanding that emerges through conversation
- **Boundary effects**: The moment when shared understanding becomes visible

## Interaction

- **R**: Regenerate all elements (new conversation setup)
- **S**: Toggle visibility of wave sources (show/hide speakers)
- **D**: Toggle visibility of the central obstacle (reveal shared understanding)
- **A**: Enable auto-add mode (speakers join gradually over time)
- **M**: Toggle mouse as interactive wave source (join the conversation)

## Technical Implementation

Built with **p5.js**, the artwork uses:
- Real-time wave field calculation with multiple frequency synthesis
- Physics-based sphere movement responding to wave gradients
- Dynamic color mixing using HSB color space
- Perlin noise for organic obstacle deformation
- Optimized rendering for smooth 60fps performance

## Artistic Statement

*Sazanami* explores the invisible architecture of human dialogue. Like ripples on a pond, our words and ideas spread outward, creating patterns of interference that shape collective understanding. The artwork makes visible the usually hidden dynamics of how individual voices contribute to shared meaning.

The central obstacle represents not a barrier to communication, but the emergent structure of mutual understanding that gradually takes shape through sustained dialogue. Its boundaries become visible not through direct observation, but through the subtle ways it affects the flow of conversation around it.

The floating spheres remind us that in dialogue, we are all both speakers and listeners, sources of waves and objects moved by them. We shape the conversation even as we are shaped by it.
